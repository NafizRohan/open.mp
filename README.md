# 🚀 Open.mp Roleplay Script by Nafiz Rohan  

## 🌟 Introduction  
Hey there! I’m **Nafiz Rohan**, a teenage developer from **Bangladesh** with a love for coding and creating. Over the years, I’ve built my skills working with **SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer)**. This project represents my journey into the exciting realm of **Open.mp**, where I’m merging past experiences with modern technologies to craft something amazing for the community.
